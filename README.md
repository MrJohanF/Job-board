I developed a comprehensive platform for managing job offers, where companies can post job opportunities, identify qualified candidates, and send personalized interview invitations. The platform allows companies to manage and update their job offers, as well as view graphs that show the number of applicants and responses to interviews.

The application supports two languages, Spanish and English, and offers companies customized profiles where they can describe their mission and vision. Candidates can create verified accounts through email, while companies are manually verified by an administrator to prevent fraud.

Candidates have the ability to upload their resumes, complete additional information, and automatically generate CVs on the platform. Additionally, they can add links to presentation videos, highlight skills, and apply for job offers. The platform also facilitates the management of company invitations and sharing job opportunities with friends and family through links.

The application process is managed through a modern and accessible control panel, where candidates can monitor the progress of their applications in real-time. This comprehensive software engineering solution offers an optimized user experience for both companies and candidates, simplifying the process of searching and selecting talent in the job market.
